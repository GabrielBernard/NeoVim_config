NeoVim_config
--------------

This is a Mac OS X nvimrc file with a lot of customization.

I'm trying to improve it to be a very clear and very usefull nvimrc so that in case
something happen, I always have a backyp file to quickly setup a new nvim.

This nvimrc uses ryanoasis' nerd-fonts. It is necessary to download and install some of those fonts
to have access to the icons in airline, NEERDTree, ctrl-p, etc.

I use nvim in my terminal so the non-ascii font must be setup to one of the patch nerd-font for the
icons to show.

Lastly, my nvim is setup to use true-colors, so a true-color capable terminal must be use.
Iterm2-nightly is a very good terminal that have true-colors enable and I recommand to use it.
